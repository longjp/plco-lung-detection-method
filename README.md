## Code and Output

* Code to generate all figures and tables in the manuscript is contained in the file:
```
reports-code/20230126-plco-lung-report.Rmd
```
* This code creates a .html file and outputs figures and tables to the folder:
```
reports-code/20230126-plco-lung-report/
```
* Data (see below for instruction on how to obtain it) should be placed in folder
```
data/
```

## Obtaining the Data

* PLCO Lung data is needed to run the code and reproduce the results.
* PLCO Data may be requested from the [Cancer Data Access System](https://cdas.cancer.gov/)
* Request to obtain the same data as was used in [PLCO Project 808](https://cdas.cancer.gov/approved-projects/3140/) (this project)
* After unzipping files in the folder data/, the 20230126-plco-lung-report.Rmd can generate results.
