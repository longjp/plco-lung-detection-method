\caption{\label{tab:unnamed-chunk-29}Permutation Variable Importance in Random Survival Forests Models. Detection is the second most important variable, after Stage, in the 4-Year Cohort. In the Extended Cohort, Detection is more important than both Sex and Smoked. These results show that method of detection has independent prognostic value in models other than CoxPH.\label{tab:varimp}}
